# Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, commonly referred to as "pen testing," is a proactive security assessment technique used to identify vulnerabilities in an organization's IT infrastructure,
applications, and networks.
 
 
Industry scanning tools for penetration testing include:

Nmap (Network Mapper): A powerful open-source network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
Metasploit: An advanced open-source penetration testing framework that helps security professionals assess vulnerabilities and manage security assessments.
Burp Suite: A comprehensive set of tools for web application security testing, including scanning, crawling, and exploitation.
Wireshark: A widely-used network protocol analyzer that allows security professionals to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time.
Nessus: A vulnerability scanning tool that identifies security vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and malware in networks, systems, and applications.
OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System): An open-source vulnerability scanner that performs comprehensive vulnerability assessments and provides a centralized management interface.
Acunetix: A web vulnerability scanner that automatically detects and reports web application vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure server configurations.
SQLMap: A popular open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
